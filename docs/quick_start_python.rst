Quick Start Python
==================

The use of the Python interface is pretty straight-forward since
there is only one method: :code:`evaluate(..)`.

**Example 1:** Evaluating the gravity model for a given polyhedron
defined from within source code for a specific point and density.

.. code-block:: python

        import polyhedral_gravity as model

        # Defining every input parameter in the source code
        vertices = ...          # [] of [] or np.array of length 3 and type float
        faces = ...             # [] of [] or np.array of length 3 and type int
        density = ...           # float
        computation_point = ... # [] or np.array of length 3

        # Evaluate the gravity model
        # Notice that the last argument could also be a list of points
        # Returns (list of) tuple of potential, acceleration and tensor
        potential, acceleration, tensor = model.evaluate(vertices, faces, density, computation_point)


**Example 2a:** Evaluating the gravity model for a given polyhedron
in some source files for a specific point and density.

.. code-block:: python

        import polyhedral_gravity as model

        # Reading the vertices and files from a .node and .face file
        file_vertices = '___.node'      # str, path to file
        file_nodes = '___.face'         # str, path to file
        density = ...                   # float
        computation_point = ...         # [] or np.array of length 3

        # Evaluate the gravity model
        # Notice that the last argument could also be a list of points
        # Returns (list of) tuple of potential, acceleration and tensor
        potential, acceleration, tensor = model.evaluate([file_vertices, file_nodes], density, computation_point)


**Example 2b:** Evaluating the gravity model for a given polyhedron
in some source files for a specific point and density.

.. code-block:: python

        import polyhedral_gravity as model

        # Reading the vertices and files from a single .mesh file
        file = '___.mesh'       # str, path to file
        density = ...           # float
        computation_point = ... # [] or np.array of length 3

        # Evaluate the gravity model
        # Notice that the last argument could also be a list of points
        # Returns (list of) tuple of potential, acceleration and tensor
        potential, acceleration, tensor = model.evaluate([mesh], density, computation_point)


For example 2a and 2b, refer to :ref:`supported-polyhedron-source-files` to view the available
options for polyhedral input.

**Example 3:** A guard statement checks that the plane unit
normals are pointing outwards and no triangular surface is degenerated.
Only use this statement if one needs clarification
about the vertices' ordering due to its quadratic complexity!

.. code-block:: python

    import polyhedral_gravity as model
    import polyhedral_gravity.utility as mesh_sanity

    # Defining every input parameter in the source code
    vertices = ...              # [] of [] or np.array of length 3 and type float
    faces = ...                 # [] of [] or np.array of length 3 and type int
    density = ...               # float
    computation_point = ...     # [] or np.array of length 3

    # Evaluate the gravity model
    # Notice that the last argument could also be a list of points
    # Returns (list of) tuple of potential, acceleration and tensor

    # Additional guard statement
    if mesh_sanity.check_mesh(vertices, faces):
        potential, acceleration, tensor = model.evaluate(vertices, faces, density, computation_point)
